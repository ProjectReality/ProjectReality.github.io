	DescrLong : "Reality is a student project conducted for the end-cycle (named EIP) from Epitech school. It is a computer system allowing the superposition of virtual images on reals images. With a software we will create, a computer will fetch images captured by two cameras, will process and restitute it to the user with the appropriates modifications. Those images will be displayed on video glasses with a screen integrated. This system, constituted of multiple devices, will immerse you in a real and three dimensional virtual world, where you will be able to explore in a predetermined area. Different sensors will allow to recognize precisely your every move like turning the head, walking, running or jumping and offer an amazing experience.
